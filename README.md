# Navigating Reason

This document is a guide for the curious newcomer to [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/), or for people looking to branch out of the most common workflows for Reason. Or maybe you're just curious about what tools are being worked on, and how they all relate. How could they converge?
If you're brand new to Reason and just want to get started as quickly as possible with compiling to JS, just go through the main [docs](https://reasonml.github.io/). This document isn't meant to explain the simplest parts of Reason - it's for people who are branching out, or who want to help us eventually unify a lot of these workflows and optional tools into something that is newcomer friendsly.

You've at least dabbled in Reason, and you've noticed that you can do much more than just compile to JavaScript. How do you do that, what is required? What tools do you need to learn, and how do all those tools relate to the ones you already know. That's what this document is for.
